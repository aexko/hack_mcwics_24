# SunnySideSavings

## Inspiration

Today, one of the biggest challenges low income people and students face is inflation, especially on grocery bills. This raises the question of how to effectively spend your money on groceries. This is why we built SunnySideSavings, an all-in-one website with an integrated price tracker where you can find the best deals.
## What it does

Users can do their groceries on SunnySideSavings. It tracks prices from different grocery stores and compares them to determine the best price. Moreover, a graph of previous prices is integrated for a particular store on every item.
## How we built it

We used Django as our main framework to build the app, Bootstrap was used for styling since the developer does not perform well in that area, and Figma for UI design.
## Challenges we ran into

Regarding Figma, we had to think about simplifying the information to make the user's experience more intuitive. Also, our team navigated the complexity of limited coding expertise. Opting for Django for its rapid development capabilities over HTML/CSS/JavaScript posed initial hurdles. Integrating Bootstrap for styling alleviated some issues, yet static file complications persisted, hindering image display. Striking a balance between functionality and aesthetics within the tight timeframe proved challenging. This experience emphasized the importance of strategic planning and leveraging team strengths. Despite obstacles, our collective effort prevailed. Moving forward, we prioritize fostering collaboration and enhancing technical skills to confront future challenges with confidence.
